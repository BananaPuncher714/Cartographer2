# vanilla and default are the autogenerated palettes. You cannot edit default, but it will update according to the version of the server
# vanilla will save inside the presets folder, and you can edit that. However, it does not update. You can delete it to regenerate it
# It is not advised to use *only* these presets without another one as backup, in case if some block is mapped as transparent(water)
# You *can* edit the vanilla preset though. That should help somewhat.
