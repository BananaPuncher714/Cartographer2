# Default provided locale file
# All local files require a locale-code. It should not have any whitespaces
# The name, language, and location are optional, but recommended
# Information taken from https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Language#Available_languages
# The messages themselves follow regular Java string formatting
# If you want to have random messages, make a string list instead of a single string
# For example:
# random-message-list:
# - "Random message 1"
# - "Random message 2"
# - "Random message 3"
# These locale files also support placeholders, if it's a message for a player.
# To use custom colored messages, use the section symbol(§) directly.
# If that doesn't work, and shows up with some random character, then use the code \u00a7 instead.
