# Cartographer 2
## About:
### What is this?
Cartographer 2 aims to be a more object oriented, asynchronous and faster version of the original Cartographer, which is outdated.

### Plans
I have several objectives I would like to meet with the final product of Cartographer:
- Asynchronous chunk processing
- Fast and efficient image processing
- Asynchronous packet sending
- Customizable for users
- Modular for developers
