# Experimental Module for Cartographer2
This module is a testing ground for the latest versions of Cartographer. It's where I(BananaPuncher714) test out mechanics and features that may eventually find its way into Cartographer, as well as a base for testing the module system and seeing what can be made easier/accessible for developers. Some features may also be turned into a separate module.

## Current features
- Testing unicode font
- Testing map menus
- Testing custom locale system
